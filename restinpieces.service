[Service]
# User and Group
User=${RESTINPIECES_APP}
Group=${RESTINPIECES_APP}

# Working Directory
WorkingDirectory=/home/${RESTINPIECES_APP}

# Command to start the service
ExecStart=/home/${RESTINPIECES_APP}/bin/${RESTINPIECES_APP} -dbpath data/app.db -agekey age.key

# Capabilities:
# This grants the ability to bind to privileged ports (<1024)
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
# CapabilityBoundingSet limits the *maximum* capabilities the process can ever have.
# It's good practice to set this to the same as AmbientCapabilities or a superset if needed.
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

# === FILESYSTEM HARDENING ===

# What it does: It ensures that the service process and any of its children can
# never gain more privileges than they had at startup. Specifically, it ignores
# the "Set-User-ID" (SUID) and "Set-Group-ID" (SGID) bits on binaries.
#
# Why use it: It prevents privilege escalation attacks. Even if an attacker
# finds a way to run a shell, they cannot run sudo or use binaries like passwd
# to gain root access.
NoNewPrivileges=true

# What it does: It mounts the entire file system hierarchy as Read-Only for
# this service, with very few exceptions (usually /dev, /proc, and /sys).
#
# Why use it: It prevents an attacker from modifying system files, installing
# permanent malware, or tampering with configuration files in /etc.
#
# ProtectSystem=full            
ProtectSystem=strict

# What it does: It mounts a temporary, empty filesystem (tmpfs) over /home,
# /root, and /run/user.
#
# Why use it: It protects user data. The service sees an empty /home directory.
# This ensures the service cannot steal SSH keys, documents, or personal data
# from real users on the server.
#
# Example: If your service tries to list /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa, it will
# likely see an empty directory or "file not found," protecting your SSH keys.
#
# - The Host Layer (Real Disk): On your actual hard drive,
# /home/myapp/data/db.sqlite exists physically.
# - The Protection Layer (ProtectHome=tmpfs): When the service starts, systemd
# creates a "sandbox" (a namespace). Inside this sandbox, it mounts a tmpfs
# (RAM disk) over /home. To the app, /home now looks empty. The real hard drive
# underneath is effectively covered by a blanket.
# The Exception Layer (ReadWritePaths): This is the crucial step.
# ReadWritePaths doesn't just grant permission; it creates a Bind Mount.
# How the Bind Mount works
# When systemd sees ReadWritePaths=/home/myapp/data, it performs the following
# logic sequence during startup: Mount tmpfs: It covers the real /home with the
# empty temporary filesystem.  Punch the Hole: It looks at the real host system,
# finds the actual folder /home/myapp/data, and mounts it on top of the temporary
# /home/myapp/data inside the sandbox.
#
#ProtectHome=true              # Makes user home directories inaccessible
ProtectHome=tmpfs

ReadWritePaths=/home/${RESTINPIECES_APP}/data

BindReadOnlyPaths=/home/${RESTINPIECES_APP}/age.key
BindReadOnlyPaths=/home/${RESTINPIECES_APP}/bin

# What it does: It gives the service its own isolated /tmp and /var/tmp
# directories. These are separate from the host system's /tmp.
#
# Why use it: Security: Prevents "tmp race" attacks where one user guesses the
# filename of another user's temp file to inject malicious data.  Privacy:
# Other users cannot see the temporary files this service creates.
PrivateTmp=true               # Service gets its own /tmp and /var/tmp

# If your app doesn't need network access *after* binding, you can restrict it further.
# RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_INET AF_INET6 # Allow common socket types

# === KERNEL PROTECTION ===

# It prevents the service from loading or unloading kernel modules (drivers).
# It stops rootkits. If an attacker gains root access inside the service, they
# might try to load a malicious kernel module to hide their presence or control
# the server at the hardware level. This blocks that.
ProtectKernelModules=true         # Can't load kernel modules

# It mounts kernel tuning directories (like /proc/sys and /sys) as read-only.
# It prevents the service from changing OS-level settings, such as enabling IP
# forwarding, changing memory management logic, or altering network stack
# behavior. Example: An attacker cannot execute echo 1 >
# /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward to turn your server into a router for their
# traffic.
ProtectKernelTunables=true        # Can't modify kernel tunables

ProtectKernelLogs=true            # Can't read kernel logs
ProtectControlGroups=true         # cgroups read-only

# Restart behavior
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s       # Time to wait before restarting

# Standard output and error logging
# 'journal' sends logs to the systemd journal
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
# Alternatively, to append to files (ensure mygoappuser has write permissions):
# StandardOutput=append:/var/log/mygoapp/app.log
# StandardError=append:/var/log/mygoapp/error.log

# Environment variables (optional)
# Environment="GIN_MODE=release"
# Environment="PORT=80"
# EnvironmentFile=/etc/mygoapp/environment.conf # For many variables

# Resource limits (optional)
# LimitNOFILE=65536 # Max open files

# Type of service
# 'simple' is common for Go apps that don't fork and run in the foreground.
# If your Go app uses systemd's sd_notify mechanism, use Type=notify
Type=simple
