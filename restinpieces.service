[Service]
# User and Group
User=restinpieces
Group=restinpieces

# Working Directory
WorkingDirectory=/opt/restinpieces

# Command to start the service
# Adjust arguments as needed. TODO 
ExecStart=/opt/restinpieces/restinpieces -dbpath app.db -agekey age_key.txt 

# Capabilities:
# This grants the ability to bind to privileged ports (<1024)
AmbientCapabilities=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
# CapabilityBoundingSet limits the *maximum* capabilities the process can ever have.
# It's good practice to set this to the same as AmbientCapabilities or a superset if needed.
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE

# Security Hardening (Highly Recommended)
NoNewPrivileges=true          # Prevents the service from gaining more privileges
ProtectSystem=full            # Makes /usr, /boot, /etc read-only (except /etc/mygoapp if specified in ReadWritePaths)
ProtectHome=true              # Makes user home directories inaccessible
PrivateTmp=true               # Service gets its own /tmp and /var/tmp
# If your app needs to write to specific paths (e.g., logs, data), uncomment and adjust:
# ReadWritePaths=/var/log/mygoapp /var/lib/mygoapp
# If your app doesn't need network access *after* binding, you can restrict it further.
# RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_INET AF_INET6 # Allow common socket types

# Restart behavior
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5s       # Time to wait before restarting

# Standard output and error logging
# 'journal' sends logs to the systemd journal
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
# Alternatively, to append to files (ensure mygoappuser has write permissions):
# StandardOutput=append:/var/log/mygoapp/app.log
# StandardError=append:/var/log/mygoapp/error.log

# Environment variables (optional)
# Environment="GIN_MODE=release"
# Environment="PORT=80"
# EnvironmentFile=/etc/mygoapp/environment.conf # For many variables

# Resource limits (optional)
# LimitNOFILE=65536 # Max open files

# Type of service
# 'simple' is common for Go apps that don't fork and run in the foreground.
# If your Go app uses systemd's sd_notify mechanism, use Type=notify
Type=simple
