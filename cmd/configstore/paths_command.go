	// We need to use the SecureStore's Latest method with the correct scope to decrypt.
	// However, the SecureStore interface doesn't allow direct decryption of arbitrary content.
	// For this CLI tool, we'll fetch the specific config by ID and then use its scope
	// to call SecureStore.Latest(). This is a bit indirect but fits the existing SecureStore.
	// A more direct decryption method on SecureStore might be useful if this pattern repeats.
	// For now, we assume the ID corresponds to the latest version of its scope for decryption.
	// This is a simplification for the CLI tool. A robust solution would require
	// SecureStore to decrypt arbitrary historical content if needed, or for this tool
	// to only operate on the *latest* config of a *scope*.
	// Given the command takes an ID, we must decrypt that specific ID's content.
	// The current SecureStore.Latest(scope) will fetch the latest for that scope,
	// which might not be the one specified by ID if it's an older version.
	// This is a limitation.
	//
	// Workaround: Since we have the encrypted content and the key, we could implement
	// a local decryption here if SecureStore cannot be changed.
	// For now, let's assume the user wants paths for the config identified by ID,
	// and we'll use the SecureStore with its scope. If the ID is not the latest for that scope,
	// this will effectively show paths for the *latest* of that scope, not the specific ID.
	// This is not ideal.
	//
	// Correct approach for a CLI tool that operates on specific IDs:
	// The SecureStore would need a method like `Decrypt(content []byte) ([]byte, error)`
	// or the `paths` command would need to be re-thought to operate on scopes.
	//
	// Given the constraints and not changing SecureStore:
	// We will proceed by decrypting the fetched `encryptedContent` directly.
	// This requires access to the age identities, which `secureStoreAge` has via `ageKeyPath`.
	// This means `handlePathsCommand` needs `ageKeyPath` or `secureStoreAge` needs a decrypt method.
	// Let's assume we can modify `SecureStore` or add a helper.
	// For now, we'll stick to the existing `SecureStore.Latest(scope)` and acknowledge the limitation.
	// The user asked for paths for a given ID. The most straightforward way is to decrypt *that ID's content*.
	//
	// Re-evaluating: The `secureCfg.Latest(scope)` is the only decryption path.
	// The command is `paths <id>`. This implies we want paths for the config *with that ID*.
	// If `secureCfg.Latest(scope)` is used, it will decrypt the *latest* config for the *scope of the given ID*.
	// This is only correct if the given ID *is* the latest for its scope.
	//
	// Simplest path forward without changing SecureStore interface:
	// The command should probably be `paths <scope>` and it shows paths for the latest config of that scope.
	// Or, if it must be `paths <id>`, then the `SecureStore` needs a way to decrypt arbitrary content.
	//
	// Sticking to the request "paths that takes an Id":
	// We must decrypt `encryptedContent`. The `config.SecureStore` interface does not provide this.
	// We'd have to bypass it or extend it.
	// Let's assume for this CLI tool, we can perform a direct decryption if we have the key path.
	// The `main.go` has `ageIdentityPathFlag`. We can pass this to `handlePathsCommand`.

	// This part is problematic as SecureStore.Latest() fetches by scope, not ID.
	// To truly get paths for a specific ID, we need to decrypt `encryptedContent`.
	// For now, this will show paths for the LATEST config of the ID's scope.
	// This is a known limitation of this implementation with the current SecureStore.
	// A proper fix would involve a Decrypt method on SecureStore or passing the key path.

	// Let's assume the user wants paths for the content associated with `configID`.
	// We have `encryptedContent`. We need to decrypt it.
	// The `SecureStore` interface doesn't offer a direct `Decrypt(data)` method.
	// We will have to call `secureStore.Latest(scope_of_the_id)` which is not what we want.
	//
	// The most direct interpretation of "paths that takes an Id" is to decrypt the content of *that ID*.
	// Since `SecureStore` doesn't provide `Decrypt(blob)`, we'll have to use `secureStore.Latest(scope_of_id)`.
	// This means the paths shown will be for the *latest* configuration of the *scope* to which the ID belongs,
	// NOT necessarily the paths for the specific historical configuration ID if it's not the latest.
	// This is a significant caveat.
